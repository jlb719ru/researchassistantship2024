            <abstract>County boundaries for Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, 
Maryland, New York, Connecticut, and the District of Columbia. Original 
Sources: PA - PennDOT NJ - NJOIT DE - DE Geological Survey MD, NY, CT, 
DC - ESRI Linework has been adjusted using the following methodology. 
NJ's boundaries overrode PA, since NJ's were highly accurate. PA 
overrode MD since PennDOT's were more accurate than ESRI's, and DE 
overrode PA &amp;amp; MD, since the &amp;quot;arc&amp;quot; of northernmost DE was a bit more 
accurate than PennDOT's or our original county boundaries. County 
boundaries in the DVRPC region have been adjusted to align with parcel 
data (where appropriate). NOTE: Use the following definition query if 
only need one county in DVRPC Region &amp;quot;Co_Name&amp;quot; LIKE '%Bucks%'</abstract>
